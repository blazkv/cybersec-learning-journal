# NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)

This writeup summarizes my research and reflections on the NIST Cybersecurity Framework ‚Äî its structure, core functions, and how it's used to guide cybersecurity programs in practice.

## üìù Definition  
The NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) is a set of standards, guidelines, and best practices developed by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology. It provides a flexible and repeatable structure for organizations to identify, protect against, detect, respond to, and recover from cybersecurity threats.

Originally published in 2014 and updated to version 2.0 in 2024, the CSF is designed to improve critical infrastructure security but has been widely adopted across both public and private sectors.

## ‚ùó Why It Matters  
*Explain why CSF is important in cybersecurity governance and risk management. What problem does it solve? Why do so many organizations adopt it?*

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works / Core Components  

The CSF is organized into several key components:

- **Core Functions**:  
  The framework is built around five core functions that describe the lifecycle of cybersecurity risk management:
  - **Identify**  
  - **Protect**  
  - **Detect**  
  - **Respond**  
  - **Recover**

- **Categories & Subcategories**:  
  Each function is divided into categories and subcategories representing specific outcomes or controls.

- **Implementation Tiers**:  
  These describe how an organization views risk and the processes they have in place.

- **Profiles**:  
  A way for organizations to tailor the CSF to their business requirements, risk tolerance, and resources.

## üîç Real-World Applications  
*Give a real-world or hypothetical example of an organization applying the CSF. You can reference sectors like healthcare, energy (HSE again?), finance, etc. Mention how CSF helps prioritize controls, assess maturity, or respond to incidents.*

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Challenges / Common Pitfalls  
- Misinterpreting the CSF as a compliance checklist rather than a flexible guide.
- Failing to align CSF implementation with business goals or risk appetite.
- Overlooking the importance of continuous assessment and adaptation.
- Assuming it's U.S.-only ‚Äî when in fact, it‚Äôs globally applicable and often used outside the U.S.
