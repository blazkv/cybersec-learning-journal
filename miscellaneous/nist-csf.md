# NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)

This writeup summarizes my research and reflections on the NIST CSF. I take a look at its structure, core functions, and how it's used to guide cybersecurity programs in practice.

## üìù Definition  

The [NIST CSF](https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework) is primarily a **risk management** tool designed to help organizations identify, assess, and reduce cybersecurity risks in a structured, flexible, and repeatable way. Rather than focusing solely on specific technical controls, it aligns cybersecurity efforts with an organization‚Äôs unique risk tolerance and business objectives.

Organized around five core functions, **Identify**, **Protect**, **Detect**, **Respond**, and **Recover**, the CSF provides a comprehensive lifecycle approach to managing cyber risk. This framework helps organizations prioritize their security activities based on what matters most, ensuring resources are used effectively to reduce the likelihood and impact of cyber incidents.

## ‚ùó Why It Matters

It's important because it provides organizations with a common language and systematic approach to managing cybersecurity risks. Without a structured framework, organizations may struggle to prioritize security investments or respond effectively to incidents.

By adopting the CSF, organizations can align **cybersecurity efforts** with **business objectives** and **risk tolerance**, making security decisions that support overall organizational goals. This helps reduce vulnerabilities, improve threat detection, and enhance response and recovery capabilities.

Additionally, the CSF promotes **communication** and **coordination** across departments and with external partners, fostering a culture of security awareness that is essential for effective risk management.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works / Core Components  

The CSF is organized into several key components:

- **Core Functions**:  
  The framework is built around five core functions that describe the lifecycle of cybersecurity risk management:
  - **Identify**  
  - **Protect**  
  - **Detect**  
  - **Respond**  
  - **Recover**

- **Categories & Subcategories**:  
  Each function is divided into categories and subcategories representing specific outcomes or controls.

- **Implementation Tiers**:  
  These describe how an organization views risk and the processes they have in place.

- **Profiles**:  
  A way for organizations to tailor the CSF to their business requirements, risk tolerance, and resources.

## üîç Real-World Applications  
*Give a real-world or hypothetical example of an organization applying the CSF. You can reference sectors like healthcare, energy (HSE again?), finance, etc. Mention how CSF helps prioritize controls, assess maturity, or respond to incidents.*

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Challenges / Common Pitfalls  
- Misinterpreting the CSF as a compliance checklist rather than a flexible guide.
- Failing to align CSF implementation with business goals or risk appetite.
- Overlooking the importance of continuous assessment and adaptation.
- Assuming it's U.S.-only ‚Äî when in fact, it‚Äôs globally applicable and often used outside the U.S.
