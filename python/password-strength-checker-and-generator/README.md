# Password Strength Checker & Generator

## 📌 Context

This small project helped me refresh my Python basics and get more comfortable with Python-specific tools: working with external packages like `pyperclip`, using modules like `string` and `secrets`, and setting up a simple `venv` to keep everything organized. My goal is to gradually build a toolkit of small, useful scripts that improve both my coding fluency and my security mindset.
