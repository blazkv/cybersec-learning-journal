# TryHackMe ‚Äì Pre Security

The **Pre Security** path on TryHackMe provides a solid foundation in cybersecurity fundamentals. While I‚Äôve studied much of this content before through formal Information Security courses and the Cyber Security 101 path, I‚Äôm revisiting it to strengthen core knowledge and close any remaining gaps, especially in areas relevant to a Security Operations Center role. This write-up is a minimal but informative summary of my progress and does not reflect my full set of notes.

## üõ°Ô∏è 1. Introduction to Cyber Security

### **Offensive Security Intro**

This section introduced **Offensive Security**, which involves simulating cyberattacks to identify and exploit system vulnerabilities before malicious actors do.

* Worked through a mock **online banking simulation** using a Linux terminal.
* Learned to use the `derb` command-line tool for **directory enumeration**, scanning accessible directories and files on a web server.
* Identified two vulnerable URLs and manipulated account balances, illustrating exploitation of web application flaws.
* Although familiar with terminal navigation, this was my first experience with `derb`, expanding my awareness of penetration testing tools.

### **Defensive Security Intro**

This section focused on **Defensive Security**, aligned with **Blue Team** functions such as monitoring, detection, analysis, and incident response.

* Introduced the structure and function of a **Security Operations Center (SOC)**:
  * Centralized team monitoring systems for vulnerabilities, policy violations, and indicators of compromise (IOCs).
  * Uses a **SIEM (Security Information and Event Management)** platform for log aggregation and analysis.
* Learned about **Threat Intelligence** ‚Äî collecting and analyzing internal and external data to identify adversary tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs).
* Covered fundamentals of **DFIR (Digital Forensics and Incident Response)**:
  * **Digital Forensics**: Examining logs, memory dumps, file systems, and network traffic to reconstruct attacks.
  * **Incident Response**: Minimizing damage and recovery time via preparation, detection, containment, and post-incident review.
  * **Malware Analysis**: Both **static analysis** (code review without execution) and **dynamic analysis** (sandboxed execution to observe behavior).
* Completed a simulated SOC workflow:
  * Investigated malicious log entries in a mock SIEM.
  * Used a threat intel platform (modeled after **AbuseIPDB** and **Cisco Talos Intelligence**) to analyze suspicious IPs.
  * Escalated incidents and blocked malicious IPs, simulating full response procedures.

## üì° 2. Network Fundamentals

### **What is Networking?**

Explored the fundamentals of **computer networks** ‚Äî interconnected devices sharing data.
* Visual analogy of individuals forming a network to illustrate data flow.
* Scaled to the **Internet**, a global network made of smaller public and private networks.

Key device identifiers:
* **IP Address (Internet Protocol)**:
  * **Private IPs**: Used within local networks.
  * **Public IPs**: Assigned by the **ISP (Internet Service Provider)** for external communication.
  * Covered differences between **IPv4** (32-bit) and **IPv6** (128-bit), with IPv6 adoption due to IPv4 exhaustion.
* **MAC Address (Media Access Control)**:
  * Unique hardware identifier for network interfaces (e.g., `a4:c3:f0:85:ac:2d`).
  * Explored **MAC spoofing** as a technique to bypass weak security controls.

Networking tools:
* **Ping**:
  * Sends **ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)** packets to test reachability and latency.
  * Practiced with `ping 8.8.8.8` to verify connectivity.

### Premium-Only Content

Remaining topics are locked behind a **TryHackMe Premium** subscription:

* **Intro to LAN**
* **OSI Model**
* **Packets & Frames**
* **Extending Your Network**

I plan to revisit these critical networking topics once accessible.

## üåê 3. How the Web Works

### **DNS in Detail**

Studied the **Domain Name System (DNS)**, which translates domain names into IP addresses.
* Domains structured as **Top-Level Domain (TLD)**, **Second-Level Domain**, and optional **subdomains**.
* Key **DNS record types**:
  * `A` (IPv4), `AAAA` (IPv6), `CNAME` (alias), `MX` (mail), and `TXT` (text, verification).
* DNS resolution flow:
  * Local cache ‚Üí ISP recursive DNS ‚Üí Root servers ‚Üí TLD servers ‚Üí Authoritative servers.
  * Results cached according to **TTL (Time To Live)**.
* Hands-on practice using `nslookup` to query DNS records.

### **HTTP in Detail**

Covered **HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol)** and **HTTPS (HTTP Secure)** protocols.
* HTTP transmits data in plaintext; HTTPS secures data using **TLS (Transport Layer Security)** encryption.
* Reviewed HTTP methods:
  * `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE` specify client-server actions.
* Analyzed common HTTP status codes:
  * `200 OK`, `404 Not Found`, `403 Forbidden`, `301/302 Redirect`, `500 Internal Server Error`.
* Compared request and response headers:
  * Requests include `Host`, `User-Agent`, `Cookie`.
  * Responses include `Set-Cookie`, `Content-Type`, `Cache-Control`.

### **How Websites Work**

This section explained how web browsers interact with servers. When **visiting a website**, your **browser** sends a **request** to a **web server** (a remote computer that processes these requests). The server responds with **data** that the browser uses to **render the website**.

Websites consist of two major components:
- **Front End** (Client-side): What the user sees ‚Äî how the browser displays content.
- **Back End** (Server-side): Handles logic, processes requests, and delivers responses.

Web content is primarily built using **HTML (HyperText Markup Language)**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**:
- HTML provides structure using elements like `<html>`, `<body>`, and `<p>`. It begins with a `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration to define the document type.
- HTML elements can include attributes ‚Äî for example: `<p attribute1="value1" attribute2="value2">`.
- **CSS** styles these elements, while **JavaScript** adds interactivity.

I‚Äôve already taught myself the fundamentals of the **MERN stack** and used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in previous projects. I also practiced viewing the **HTML source code** of web pages using browser tools like ‚ÄúView Page Source.‚Äù

JavaScript can be included directly within HTML using the `<script>` tag, or externally via: `<script src="/path/to/file.js"></script>`.

In this task, I practiced modifying content dynamically using JavaScript and the `document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML` method.

Security was also a key focus:
- Emphasized avoiding **sensitive data exposure** ‚Äî credentials or tokens should never appear in the page source.
- I inspected a mock website to locate exposed credentials and used them to log into the **TryHackMe** platform.

Finally, the task introduced **HTML injection** ‚Äî a **client-side vulnerability** where unvalidated user input is rendered directly into the page‚Äôs DOM. If input isn't sanitized, attackers can inject HTML or JavaScript to alter behavior or steal data. The exercise concluded with simulating an injection attack by submitting an `<a>` tag that redirected to a malicious site instead of entering credentials.

### **Putting it all together**

When you **request a website**, your computer must determine the **IP address** of the web server it needs to communicate with. This is handled by the **DNS**, which translates human-readable domain names into numerical IP addresses. Once the IP is resolved, your computer establishes a connection and communicates with the web server using the **HTTP** ‚Äî a standardized set of rules for data exchange. The server responds by sending resources such as **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, and **images**, which the **browser** uses to properly **render and display the website** to the user.

To support scalability, performance, and security, modern web applications often use additional infrastructure:
* **Load Balancers** distribute incoming traffic across multiple servers using algorithms like **round-robin** or **least connections**, ensuring **high availability** and automatic **failover** through periodic **health checks**.
* **CDNs (Content Delivery Networks)** cache and serve static assets (e.g., JavaScript, CSS, images) from geographically distributed nodes to reduce latency and server load.
* **Databases** store and retrieve user and application data, ranging from simple flat files to complex systems like **MySQL**, **Postgres**, or **MongoDB**, supporting both performance and redundancy.
* **WAFs (Web Application Firewalls)** act as a protective layer between users and web servers, filtering out malicious traffic using **rate limiting**, **signature-based detection**, and **bot filtering**.

A **web server** is software (e.g., **Apache**, **Nginx**, **IIS**, **NodeJS**) that listens for incoming connections and serves content over **HTTP** from a defined **root directory** (e.g., `/var/www/html` or `C:\inetpub\wwwroot`). When a client requests a file, the server maps the URL path to a local file and returns it.
* **Virtual Hosts** allow one server to host multiple domain names by matching the requested hostname to configuration files, each with its own root directory.
* **Static content** (e.g., images, CSS, HTML) is delivered directly without changes.
* **Dynamic content** is generated on request via **backend scripts** that can interact with databases or user input, returning different results based on context.

Common **backend languages** include **PHP**, **Python**, **NodeJS**, and **Ruby**, enabling features like user interaction, data processing, and content generation.

As my last task, I had to place in order how a request to a website works. The answer was:
**Request DNS** ‚Üí check **local cache** for IP address ‚Üí check your **recursive DNS server** for the address ‚Üí query **root server** to find the **authoritative DNS server** ‚Üí authoritative server returns the IP address for the website ‚Üí request passes through a **Web Application Firewall** ‚Üí then through a **load balancer** ‚Üí connect to the **web server** on port **80** or **443** ‚Üí web server receives the **GET request** ‚Üí **web application** queries the **database** ‚Üí your **browser renders** the HTML into a viewable website.
